                Muhammad Ali born Cassius Clay, was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 14th, 1942. Clay grew up in the south where public facilities were segregated. His father supported him, his brother, and his mother by painting billboards and signs. At a young age, Clay started boxing and started advancing through the small ranks  of the boxing profession. As he continued to practice and become better,  he eventually won an Olympic gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. Throughout his early boxing stages, he was not just known for his boxing skills, but for his freedom to express his thoughts  and charm. He was a poet, always captivating his audience with his beliefs and outcomes at the conferences. A famous phrase used by Clay is   ‚Äúfloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee‚Äù and always tell the world that he was the greatest. Right after his fight against Sonny Liston Clay accepted the teachings of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. After a few years,   at the height of the Vietnam war, Ali was drafted to the Vietnam war but he refused to join the U.S. army and help them fight. Due to his blunt statements he was stripped of his titles and was sentenced to serve five years, but was out on bail.
