               We are striving today for freedom, justice, and equality, and as a matter of fact the whole world is fighting for freedom, justice, and equality. And I would like for you to know more about my leader and my teacher, the honorable Elijah Muhammad. I'm signing autographs today, too, and we have newspapers here entitled ‚ÄúMuhammed Speaks‚Äù. And these newspapers are sold for a cheap, cheap price and just 20 cents, and you cannot buy the wisdom, knowledge and understanding that's in this newspaper, and I would like to see as many of you as possible who can afford it buy one of these papers. And I don't care if you buy 4,000 of them; I'll be here until I sign every paper, every one. If you just line up for miles, I'll stay here and sign these papers. It's just that important for you, and the money‚Ä¶ I'm not here for the money as you know. I'm averaging around 2 million a year. You all are not crazy. You're not fools. You're intelligent. This is 1967. People are going to the moon, other countries that were slaves of the masters are getting independence, and if you check it down, get right down to it, we don't know who we are! Huh. If I said it was Mr. Chang Chong you'd bet you‚Äôre a China man. If I said here comes Mr. Khrushchev you look for a Russian. If I said here comes Mr. Goldberg you‚Äôd look for Jew. If I said here comes Mr. White Cloud you‚Äôd look for an Indian. If I said here comes Mr. Castro you look for a Cuban. Here comes Mr. Mumumba, Mr. Kenyatta, you look for an African, a black man. Now, what's your last name? If I said here comes Mr. Jones, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Clay, Mr. Culpepper, Mr. Roundtree, you won't know if he's black or white until you see himWe were named after our slave masters, so teaches the honorable Elijah Muhammad, when we first were brought to America. We were robbed of all knowledge of ourselves. Mentally, we are not free. See, Jesus said ‚Äúthe truth shall make you free‚Äù. The truth alone. You shall know the truth and that will make you free. He didn't say sitting in, laying in, walking in, forcing integrating in. Truth! And once you become free to find out who you are then you'll start saying ‚ÄúI am the greatest!‚Äù.We look at Miss America, we see white. We look at Miss World, we see white. We look at Miss Universe, we see white. Even Tarzan, the King of the Jungle in black Africa: he‚Äôs white! We can't go to heaven until we're washed in the Lamb‚Äôs blood til we‚Äôre white as snow! When we get to heaven we walk on a milky white way! We were taught when we were little children that ‚ÄúMary had a little lamb, his fleece was white as snow‚Äù. Then we were taught about Snow White! This is not funny this is serious. It's a fact, true fact. White Owl cigars, White Swan soap, King White soap, White Cloud tissue paper, White Rain hairspray, White Tornado floor wax, White Plus toothpaste. All the good cowboys ride on white horses. The White House! Angel food cake is the white cake, but the devil food cake is the chocolate cake.‚ÄúWhen the white man came to America/ he needed someone to work the land/ his back was too weak/ he needed you, black man!/ So he commissioned Sir John Hawkins/ to commit the world's most grievous sin/ that is to take a man who's born to be free/ and bring him down to slavery/ sell a man as merchandise/ on his body put a price/ so my friends it's easy to tell/ white man‚Äôs heaven is a black man‚Äôs hell!‚Äù
