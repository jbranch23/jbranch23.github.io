                Ali is giving a speech to a crowd of black students at Howard University to show them that. During the time of the Civil Rights Era a lot of people were being influenced by powerful black speakers, such as Malcom X and MLK. This meant that a lot of people were converging to different religions or gaining different beliefs, like when Malcom X converged to the Nation Of Islam a lot of famous people were doing it as well even Muhammad Ali. He was influenced to join the Nation Of Islam due to Malcom X being his mentor early on. After he was converged it led to him spreading the belief in the Nation Of Islam everywhere else when he was giving speeches like in the speech we are reading he is literally giving a 20 second like ad to tell these people to buy this book whether you have money or not. I think his main purpose is not just for him to get people to converge to the Nation Of Islam, but to encourage these people to join a belief system. The main reason why Ali is coming to Howard University and giving them a speech about his own religion and telling them on the realism of Racism is due to the fact that the Vietnam war is at its highest peak and random men are being sent draft letters to join forcefully. He most likely wonâ€™t speak on it too much due to the fact that he wasnâ€™t drafted yet, but others are and they have to go to army without a choice and Ali is trying to expand on the fact that you don't have to do something you donâ€™t want to do or believe in. Ali, as a huge growing fighter, who had just beat one of the best fighters in heavyweight boxing, would be one of the best people to give this speech because he was literally the biggest person in the United States. This really allowed people to listen to him and spread the information he is telling them, especially as young adults.
