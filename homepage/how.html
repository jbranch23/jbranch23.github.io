                At the end of the Civil Rights Era, along with the height of the vietnam war, Ali gave a speech to a crowd of young students at Howard University. Ali’s speech shows his views of society to these students that there is white dominance everywhere. He emphasizes the amount of white dominance in media, industries, and even food. By use of repetition, compare & contrast, and cause & effect. Ali successfully teaches the young students at Howard University that their identities are being taken away from them, due to white dominance incorporated into other people's lives.

Ali’s references his teacher the Elijah Muhammad and multiple names of people of different races in order to show the difference between someone with their own name and someone with a slavemastered name. Later in his speech, Ali starts talking about random names and uses them to show the identity involved with someone's name. As he states, “We were named after our slave masters, so teaches the honorable Elijah Muhammad, when we first were brought to America. We were robbed of all knowledge of ourselves. Mentally, we are not free. See, Jesus said “the truth shall make you free.” He didn't say sitting in, laying in, walking in, forcing integrating in. Truth! And once you become free to find out who you are then you'll start saying “I am the greatest!” Ali’s use of peoples name being changed and it changing their identity showed the Cause and Effect that was necessary for him to use in order to convince these kids that they can’t be free until they know themselves. Although Ali was trying to promote his mentor's teaching, he really wanted these young students to realize it’s not a win without themselves.

In Ali’s speech he utilizes the frequent repetition to bring up the problem of identity for blacks in America as they’re names are white names. He goes on to point out that with other last names “If I said it was Mr. Chang Chong you'd bet you’re a China man.  If I said, "Here comes Mr. Khrushchev, you look for a Russian.” one would be able to identify which race/nationality that person is from. Whereas when it came to a black man's name, they wouldn’t be able to tell the difference from white people. He repeatedly called out the names “Mr. Jones, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Clay, Mr. Culpepper, Mr. Roundtree '' as names that could not be identified between black or white. Ali would say that those blacks names “were named after [their] slave masters” and were sripped of their origen. Ali goes on to say that there are “22 million people who don't have [their] names'' because of the control of white over blacks, and how whites shaped black names. The idea of freedom from white rule was always with them being their own name. Without a name how is one supposed to identify themselves? 

Ali later references to the history of black america and how they were stripped of their identity and forced into slavery and into slave names. Incorporating examples and instances of white dominance in American history through various industries and in American society as a whole, “We look at Miss America, we see white. We look at Miss World, we see white. We look at Miss Universe, we see white. Even Tarzan, the King of the Jungle in black Africa: he’s white!”, “The White House! Angel food cake is the white cake, but the devil food cake is the chocolate cake.” While expressing to his audience the importance of your own truth of being known and being proud of it. “See, Jesus said “the truth shall make you free”. The truth alone. You shall know the truth and that will make you free. He didn't say sitting in, laying in, walking in, forcing integrating in. Truth! And once you become free to find out who you are then you'll start saying “I am the greatest!”.” By incorporating and supporting an idea of a religion that contradicts his own beliefs, Ali implies that it’s universal, strengthening his claim while connecting to his advocacy for black pride.

Throughout his speech, Ali makes various connections and reference points in American history, focusing on white dominance within many aspects of life, while pressing the importance of not only recognizing it, but overcoming it. Advocating for black pride to his audience in a serious yet positive tone.
